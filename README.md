# Movie Box Office Revenue Prediction

## Description
This project uses machine learning models to predict the box office revenue of movies based on various features. It demonstrates the implementation of multiple models, including:

- Random Forest
- Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The project explores the performance of these models using training and test datasets, with metrics such as RMSE and RÂ² scores for evaluation.
